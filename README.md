# Events Organizer Application
	An OOP-based app, with stratified architecture design & a dual repository (in-memory and file). The app can perform CRUD operations on events, participants and enrollments. It can search for entities by keywords or generate reports using DTOs (e.g.: events with most enrolled participants, participants enrolled in most events). Unit testing has been added. Added custom exceptions, Entity validators and a generic repository.
