# Events Organizer Application
	An OOP-based app, with stratified architecture design (repository-service-ui-main) & a dual repository (in-memory and file). The app can perform CRUD operations on events & participants (using generic repository), and on enrollments. It can search for entities by keywords or generate reports using DTOs (e.g.: events with most enrolled participants, participants enrolled in most events). Unit testing has been added. Added custom exceptions, Entity validators.
